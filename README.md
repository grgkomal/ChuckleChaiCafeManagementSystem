The Food Order Management System is a C++ console-based project created to simplify everyday operations in a Cafe.
With an easy-to-use menu-driven interface, customers can browse food items, place their orders, and pay using cash or cardmaking the process quick and accessible.
Managers can have access to a secure admin panel that allows them to add, update, or delete menu items, review customer orders, track inventory, and monitor earnings in real time. 
Behind the scenes, the system is powered by key data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and recursion, ensuring efficient and dynamic handling of restaurant tasks.
It includes well-structured functions like insertfirst, updatefood, and order_view to maintain modularity and clarity. Built-in functions like clear() and sleep() enhance usability by refreshing the display and introducing smooth delays. 
Persistent file handling supports daily backups, making the system both practical and reliable.
